        The BODIOS clientele spans Switzerland, Europe, Asia, Japan, and beyond, reflecting the global allure of our exquisite yak down garments. Native to Mongolia's rugged, high-altitude terrain, the yak produces naturally sumptuous fibers that repel moisture and provide extraordinary warmth, with scientific findings revealing yak down to be inherently warmer than both merino wool and cashmere. This rare and precious textile remains undyed, crafted into 100% natural, organic garments, making each piece a statement of purity and unique luxury.

        Despite their hardy exterior, yaks yield virtually odorless down—a unique trait that renders our garments naturally scent-resistant, ideal for everyday wear as well as active and outdoor lifestyles. This exceptional material requires less frequent washing, offering longevity and enduring elegance. BODIOS invites you to experience the unmatched luxury of yak down—a textile that embodies warmth, beauty, and sustainability in every fiber. By choosing BODIOS, you not only indulge in a one-of-a-kind luxury but also support ethical practices that preserve Mongolia's nomadic animal husbandry heritage.
