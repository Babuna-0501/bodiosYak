Native to Mongolia's rugged, high-altitude terrain, the yak produces naturally sumptuous fibers that repel moisture and provide exceptional warmth. Scientific studies confirm that yak down is inherently warmer than Merino wool and cashmere, making it a truly rare and precious textile. Crafted into 100% natural, organic garments, each piece from BODIOS is a unique statement of purity and luxury."
